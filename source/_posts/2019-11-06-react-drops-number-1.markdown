When I think of Web, I think of simple things, now I started thinking in React. Let start from the very beginning.

The [why](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/why-react.html) to use React the people on Facebook already [answered](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/why-react.html), then I will write code!

The minimum code example is the following:

{% codepen dGeyxq height:300 theme-id:14691 default-tab:js %}


This code is very simple, but shows the power of React, and we are rendering an element inside a container in the DOM. The [render method](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom.render) will render or update in the element, and you can provide a callback that will be called after the element is rendered or updated.
